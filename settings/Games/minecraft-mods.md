# Minecraft Mods, Resource Packs and Shaders v1.21.1

These mods will provide a better **Vanilla experience**, but **Minecraft** specifically does not have so much in the game, I haven't tried content mods yet, but you should know that these mods could be used with content mods to provide a even better experience. Terraria don't have the same lack of content as Minecraft :v
