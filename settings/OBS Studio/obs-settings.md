# OBS Settings

A guide straight to the point with some settings to use OBS for **Streaming** and/or **Recording** and also **clipping locally**.

Any optimized way to do a step will be take into account, stop spending a lot of **CPU**, **RAM** and mainly **VRAM**!! Save your resources.

## OBS Portable Mode

There are 2 ways of using OBS in portable mode, this is essential, as you don't need to backup from an external folder.

- **Permanent (recommended)**: go to `C:\Program Files\obs-studio` or your current OBS folder, and create a file `portable_mode.txt`, this makes portable mode permanent, I've only learnt about this after joining the EnhancedBroadcast beta. If you have any settings already move from `%appdata%/obs-studio` to within the OBS folder `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\config\obs-studio` or your relative location.

- **Temporary**: use a shortcut and add the parameters to the end of the launch parameters `--portable` or `-p`.

## Run as Administrator

I still don't know the GOOD reasons exactly, but running OBS as administrator will let you setup your stuff without hassle and may give some stability improvements (?).

## Settings Guide

### ‚öôÔ∏è General

1. **Language**: here you want to set to **English** to simplify the understanding, but can go back to your language after that.
2. **Source Alignment Snapping**: make sure to enable all of the boxes of this section, and set the **sensitivity** to **10.0**.

### üì° Stream

1. Choose the platform you want to stream and search the **platform streaming settings** they recommend, this settings guide will follow with "YouTube - RTMPS" as it contains powerful codecs support.
2. Now DON'T connect your account, _only provide the stream key_, because connecting it will use a LOT of RAM and store browser cache in your OBS.
3. Always check "**Ignore streaming service setting recommendations**", trust me, this'll be useful as we want max quality and want to save resources at the same time.
4. After this, press OK and disable any new browser **dock** after enabling this option.

**YouTube only**: even if you don't have a 1440p+ monitor, create a stream key to use **1440p60**. It'll change their encoder from `avc1` (H264) to `vp09` (VP9) on _Stats for Nerds_.

### üìπ Output

Set the **Output Mode** to `Advanced`, so you can see all the options.

#### Streaming

**Remember:** make sure your **_GPU drivers_** are up to date.

> [!CAUTION]
> ALWAYS prefer using _hardware encoder_ over _software encoder_ when possible.

The **Video Encoder** quality order will usually be this way: **AV1** > **HEVC** > **H.264**

On **YouTube**, based on their _[streaming settings](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702)_, **AV1** and **HEVC** can go up to `10.000kbps` of Bitrate and **H.264** can go up to `12.000kbps`.

On **Twitch** you can bypass the `6000kbps` Bitrate and go up to `8000kbps` for some people, test it first.

<ins>Use the following settings if you find yourself in **ONE** of these situations:</ins>

1. Your Graphics Card has 8GB or less of VRAM;
   - This only applies if you are streaming GAMES;
2. Your graphics card **DOESN'T** have a dedicated chip just for encoding, sharing 3D with video encoding/decoding;
3. You are doing **multi-stream** with the same GPU (will use 2 or more encoder sessions);

<div align="center">

![Streaming Settings Hardware](./assets/obs64-av1.png)
**_VRAM USAGE:_** _70MB per encoding session_

</div>

<ins>Otherwise you can push a little more from OBS settings:</ins>

<div align="center">

![Streaming Settings Hardware 8GB+ VRAM](./assets/obs64-av1-above-8gb.png)
**_VRAM USAGE:_** _269MB per encoding session_

</div>

If you want to Stream in HDR, AV1 is not currently supported.

Always use the GPU encoder if possible! But if you can only encode from your CPU, here's some settings.

![Streaming Settings Software](./assets/obs64-software-x264.png)

If it's stuttering or using too much of your CPU (20%+), I suggest using a even faster **CPU Usage Preset**, and as a last resort decreasing the **Profile** option, but it'll hurt the quality.

#### Recording

If you are **recording** move your files away from your _system disk_ and _game disk_ if possible!

You can set your recording settings manually if you want, but know that by doing that you will use another _encoding session_ on your GPU, using more from the encoder chip and VRAM, if you need to change, go ahead.

![Recording Settings](./assets/obs64-record.png)

#### Audio

Set the **Audio Bitrate** to **320kbps** in every track, it'll sound a lot cleaner, and give more clarity to your voice.

Of course the tracks will vary if you use separate audio apps for more than 1 track. If you just stream, the **Track 1** will matter for all occasions and the **Track 2** for Twitch will matter.

For recording AND editing, if you want a good setup, here's my suggestion:

- **Track 1**: _Downmix_ (merge all sounds together)
- **Track 2**: _Game_ (or your program, only send 1 specific recurring audio to this track)
- **Track 3**: _Mic_ (your microphone audio)
- **Track 4**: _Discord_ (control the audio of your fellas)
- **Track 5**: _Browser/Player_ (focused on music only)

#### Replay Buffer

Enable if you want to clip locally, know that it'll use the same path as recording and the same settings.

- **Maximum Replay time**: 31s to approximate to ~30s.
- If you want to open OBS and start clipping (will CONSUME VRAM) add a launcher parameter to the shortcut: `--startreplaybuffer`.

Recording first as you can exceed any limit imposed by any platform, but be careful, as the file size may increase a LOT.

Sorry because I only have a 1080p monitor, so ONLY the bitrate may differ and you'll require more testing.

### üîä Audio

1. **Sample Rate**: This will depend on your audio setup, but generally is 48KHz. Remember to check your system's sound panel and make every device the same!

#### Global Audio Devices

Disable all audios from **Desktop** and **Microphones**. Create a Scene only for **audio management**, and import it to the others as needed.

### üñ•Ô∏è Video

If you have a dedicated GPU, just set it to the max resolution on **Base (Canvas) Resolution** and **Output (Scaled) Resolution** and use 60FPS.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Hotkeys

Always have keys to mute **yourself** and **Discord**. If your keyboard have a numpad, make good use of it, now it is its time to shine. Use `Alt + Num 1 to 9` to change scenes, for other keys combinations always use `ALT` first, it won't conflict with most programs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced

#### Video

For SDR content you **don't need** to change anything, but for HDR the **Color Format** will be set to `P010 (10-bit, 4:2:0, 2 planes)` and the **Color Space** will be set to `Rec .2100 (PQ)`.

#### Network

Check these boxes:

1. Enable network optimizations
2. Enable TCP Pacing

#### Sources

If unchecked and you have a **dedicated GPU**, check `Enable Browser Source Hardware Acceleration` or else it will stutter.

## The End

That's all folks! Hope this helps someone and improve your video/stream quality, not every tip is here yet because this takes some time to learn and note, but I can assure you this is mostly everything I've learnt from some trials and errors.
