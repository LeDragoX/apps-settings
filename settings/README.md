## RivaTuner (RTSS)

In this program I've set up using the **[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) SemiBold** font, it is required for aligning the monitor.

1. Click on Raster 3D one time, and set the **Font** to **Open Sans** and **Font Style** to **SemiBold**.
2. Now click on **Setup**, **Plugins** tab check the box **OverlayEditor.dll** and click on it twice.
3. Click on **Layouts**, **Load**, and open the file **ledragox-steam-deck.ovl**.
   1. If that didn't worked, click on **Layouts**, **Import** and import the file **ledragox-steam-deck.ovx**.
4. Now align the counters, press **Ctrl + S** and exit.
5. To align to the center, change the relative position on RTSS as **X: 200** for 1080p, adjust accordingly to your resolution.

## Streamer.bot

This is kinda linked to the OBS, but has no direct integration to it, check [this file for more info](./OBS%20Studio/workflow-single-screen.md)

## VS Code

Not recommended for use, this is more a public backup than anything else.

Open the IDE, press F1 and type "Open", now enter the option **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.

Just paste the lines there, save, then exit.
