# About each Setting

## Browser Extensions

A list of Browser Addons/Extensions.

## Games

The _Games_ folder is exclusive to games settings or mods I use.

Contains **Playnite** addons suggestions and a **ReShade** preset to solve TAA blur, plus some collections on **Steam Workshop** and **mods** suggestions for other games.

## Handbrake

These settings can be imported as Presets on the app.

_The "Meme" presets are to fit 10MB on Discord._

## NVIDIA Profile Inspector

Open this app and and Import the settings, then click on "**Apply Changes**".

> [!NOTE]
> There are 2 files, one forces **DLSS 4** only, the other forces **DLSS 4 + ReBar** on any game.

_Requires a NVIDIA GPU._

## OBS Studio

Contains settings for Stream/Recording, and plugins (among other things) suggestions.

## RivaTuner (RTSS)

In this program I've set up using the **[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) SemiBold** font, it is required for aligning the monitor.

1. Click on Raster 3D one time, and set the **Font** to **Open Sans** and **Font Style** to **SemiBold**.
2. Now click on **Setup**, **Plugins** tab check the box **OverlayEditor.dll** and click on it twice.
3. Click on **Layouts**, **Import**, and open the file **ledragox-steam-deck.ovx**.
4. Now align the counters, press **Ctrl + S** and exit.

## Streamer.bot

This is kinda linked to the OBS, but has no direct integration to it, check [this file for more info](./OBS%20Studio/workflow-single-screen.md)

## VS Code

Not recommended for use, this is more a public backup than anything else.

Open the IDE, press F1 and type "Open", now enter the option **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.

Just paste the lines there, save, then exit.
