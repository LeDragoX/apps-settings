# My Apps Settings

The ideia is simple, save the settings/presets for the apps I'm using publicly.

At the moments there are presets for the following softwares:

- Browser Extensions
- [HandBrake](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/releases/latest)
- [NVIDIA Profile Inspector](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/latest)
- [OBS Studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/latest)
- [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/releases/latest) (Add-ons List)
- [RivaTuner Statistics Server](https://www.guru3d.com/download/msi-afterburner-beta-download/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
